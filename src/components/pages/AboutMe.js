                    I am a React Developer and have 5 years of experience in web development. 
                    Throughout these years of experience, I have gained more skills and fully equipped myself
                    with the vital tools that come along with the React Development skills. In my recent experience,
                    I have strengthened my skills building Single Page Applications utilizing React Hooks and creating 
                    functional components. Even though my main focus is on the front end, I have contributed to back end
                    as well throughout various projects. I enjoy using NodeJS and ExpressJS to build routes to perform CRUD operations
                    on APIs.
